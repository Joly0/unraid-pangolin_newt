# --mode=go-w strips the group/other write bits from every archived member.
# The working copy sits on a share that reports 0666 for files and 0777 for
# directories, and tar otherwise packs exactly that, so installs ended up with
# a world-writable /etc/logrotate.d/pangolin_newt and /etc/cron.d/pangolin_newt.
# logrotate refuses such a config outright ("Ignoring pangolin_newt because it
# is writable by group or others"), which both mails the daily cron error to
# the user and leaves the log unrotated. The change is symbolic, so the exec
# bits set above survive, and it applies only to the archive - the working copy
# is left alone.
