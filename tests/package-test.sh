# In particular: /update.php runs the webGui wrapper script directly, so if it
# is packed without its execute bit the Connect/Apply buttons fail silently
# (this happens when building from a working copy that drops exec bits, e.g.
# an SMB share). tar records whatever mode the source tree had, so the built
# archive - not the source tree - is what has to be checked.
